/ explanation of 'regid': the Traffic Shaping mode should be selected as "not cooperative" if there are other PCs on the net, which don't have %p Traffic Shaping.

/ "Net Talk" means that %p exchanges traffic statistics with other instances of %p in the same subnet (ie. on the same router).

/ Ping Variance: cFos Speed allows and keeps statistics for variations in ping times. These variations are common in wireless (WLAN and/or UMTS) networks
