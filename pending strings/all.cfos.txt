pnet_doc_setup_p8 = "cFos PNet comes with a default user setup. The installer creates a folder <em>/users/admin</em> in the <em>pub</em> folder during installation. New users get a configuration file <em>profile.txt</em> in their respective user folder <em>/users/<username></em>. They also get a folder <em>/www/<username></em>.<br/>So if you want to share a file only with a certain user, copy it into his <em>/www/<username></em> folder instead of the <em>pub</em> folder. The <em>.htaccess</em> configuration then allows access to the file only after the user provided his/her username and password. The user can also upload into this folder (after entering the correct password). You can create and delete users and set their passwords, by using <b>/users/index.htm</b> as user \"admin\".";
