If the a client requests a certain url, say <b>/test/x/file1.txt</b>, all <em>.htaccess</em> files are evaluated for all folders the url mentions. In this example first <em>.htaccess</em> of the <em>private</em> folder is evaluated, then <em>.htaccess</em> of folder <em>pub</em>, then of folder <em>test</em>, then <em>.htaccess</em> or folder <em>x</em>.<br/>All directives are cumulative, ie. they are added or overwritten, but not deleted.";
