# Built ml-files

This is where concatenated locales from `locales.software` and `locales.website` stored.

It's used for shipment to our software packages and [website's](http://cfos.de) templates.

**DO NOT EDIT THOSE**

If you want to translate or update something â€” work with files, stored in `locales.software` and `locales.website` directories instead, otherwise all your changes may be lost.
